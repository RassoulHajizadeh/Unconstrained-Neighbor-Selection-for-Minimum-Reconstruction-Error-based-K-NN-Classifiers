# Unconstrained-Neighbor-Selection-for-Minimum-Reconstruction-Error-based-K-NN-Classifiers
In this paper, a minimum reconstruction error based K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier is proposed.

In this repository, the functions of the proposed classifiers in the paper titled "Unconstrained Neighbor Selection for Minimum Reconstruction Error-based K-NN Classifiers" are available.
